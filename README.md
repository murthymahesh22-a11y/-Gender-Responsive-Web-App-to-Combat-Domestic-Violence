# Gender-Responsive Web App — Slide Deck

Files created:

- `index.html` — The Reveal.js slide deck containing three slides: Project Overview, App User Roles & Main Functions, and Social Impact of the App.
- `assets/styles.css` — Minimal styles for readability and accessibility.

How to open

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click → Open with → your browser).

2. Navigate slides with arrow keys or on-screen controls. The deck uses Reveal.js from a CDN, so an internet connection is required to load the library.

Exporting notes

- To print/export to PDF from the browser, use the browser's Print dialog and pick "Save as PDF". For best results, Reveal.js offers a print stylesheet. You can append `?print-pdf` to the URL to use Reveal's print CSS:

  - Example (open in browser): `index.html?print-pdf`

- If you want a PPTX/PDF programmatic export later, I can add a small script using `python-pptx` to generate a basic PowerPoint from this content.

Next steps (optional)

- Add speaker notes to slides.
- Create more slides for features, wireframes, security/privacy safeguards, data model, and implementation plan.
- Generate an accessible PDF handout and translations.

If you'd like, I can also convert these slides into a PowerPoint (`.pptx`) automatically or expand the deck with design/wireframes. Which would you prefer next?
